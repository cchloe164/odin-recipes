        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            As a bumbling mess coming out of high school, the Freshman is 
            the evolution of the HS variety's Senior. It is easily 
            identifiable in the campus habitat by its wide-eyed confusion
            and the Google Maps it always welds in its hands.
        </p>
